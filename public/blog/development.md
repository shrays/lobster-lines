## Inspiration

I had been meaning to make a fun web-based project ever since I stumpled across [NEAL.FUN](https://neal.fun/) in 2021. After I finished my undergraduate thesis on **"Modeling Future Cropland Viability in the Eastern Continental,"** I took an interest in what was possible with maps and the publically available data related to them. When a friend showed me a script that scraped every Taco Bell item and price exploiting TB's own API, I knew I could make something work.

I took heavy inspiration from [McBroken](https://mcbroken.com/), a site that tracks the working status of every McDonalds ice cream machine in the US, Canada, UK, and Germany through a series of automated ice cream orders on thirty minutes. It was a huge inspiration stylistically and conceptually as I began developing this project. In terms of the user interface, [Red Lobster](https://www.redlobster.com/)'s own page was a good reference whenever I was stuck on a design decision.

## Generating a Logo:

Creating a logo is something I wanted to try when I first thought of the project. Take a look at some of my iterations:

Good thing Dalle-3 came out the day after I started this. My previous prompt of 'A bored lobster' wasn't cutting it. I iteratively used ChatGPT and Dalle 3 to generate a prompt which ended up being:
```
Create a cartoon-style vector illustration of a bored lobster logo. The lobster is is rolling his eyes, has one claw propped up against his head, and has a frown. The lobster is a muted red color.  You can see the face of the lobster and some of his side. The background is a solid white. The design should be reminiscent of modern cartoon styles, with bold lines, minimal shading, and simple and limited shapes and lines.
```
With a little photoshoping and some cleanup, I had an extremely realistic depiction of a bored lobster who has been waiting in line for a little too long.

## Future Plans
This is potentially just the beginning a few in-depth projects! My plans include:

1. Adding options to view other restaurants or services. The site was built with flexibility in mind. Through theming and modular components, the site can be changed to accomodate different datasets.
2. Calculating a cost of living index through different restaurant price variances. This would be similar to metrics like the [Big Mac Index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Mac_Index).
3. Implementing monetization with Google Ads.
