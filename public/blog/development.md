 Take a peek into the development of this project! Lobster Lines tracks and displays wait-time information for all North American Red Lobster locations. For insight into the **technical stack** and **data gathering process** I used, check out the **[RESOURCES](resources)** page.

## Inspiration

Ever since I stumbled across [NEAL.FUN](https://neal.fun/) in 2021, I have wanted to create a interactive/informative web project. After finishing an undergraduate thesis on **"Modeling Future Cropland Viability in the Eastern Continental,"** a project heavily involved in geographic data, I took an interest in what I could show with publicly available data. Little did I know I would find inspiration soon after as a friend pointed out the possibilities of using fetch requests from commercial sites.

I took heavy inspiration from [McBroken](https://mcbroken.com/), a site that tracks the working status of every McDonalds ice cream machine in the US, Canada, UK, and Germany through a series of automated ice cream orders. It was a huge inspiration stylistically and conceptually as I began developing this project. In terms of the user interface, [Red Lobster](https://www.redlobster.com/)'s own page was a good reference whenever I was stuck on a design decision.

I chose Red Lobster's API for my site as a proof on concept as the data format used and the ease of access allowed for faster development (I chose an unfortunate time to start development as the RL development team was making frequent changes to the API when I was working on this project). With this in mind, the project skeleton was built with flexibility in mind so future changes to the data and visualization types can be iterated on more easily as I transition the site to adapt to complex data.

## Generating a Logo:

Creating a logo is something I wanted to try when I first thought of the project. Since my drawing skills can be lacking at times, I decided to use some generative AI tools. Take a look at some of my iterations:

Dalle-3 was a lifesaver, coming  into public access the day after I started concepting. With this, I iteratively used ChatGPT and Dalle 3 to generate a text prompt that tied together the ideas of waiting in lines and the Red Lobster franchise.

```
Create a cartoon-style vector illustration of a bored lobster logo. The lobster is is rolling his eyes, has one claw propped up against his head, and has a frown. The lobster is a muted red color. You can see the face of the lobster and some of his side. The background is a solid white. The design should be reminiscent of modern cartoon styles, with bold lines, minimal shading, and simple and limited shapes and lines.
```

With a little cleanup in photoshop, I had an amazing depiction of a bored lobster who has been waiting in line for a little too long.

## Future Plans

As I noted above, this site is just the beginning of a in-depth data project! My plans include:

1. Add options to view other restaurants or services. Through theming and modular components, the site can be changed to accommodate different datasets.
2. Calculate a cost-of-living like index through different restaurant price variances. This would be similar to metrics like the [Big Mac Index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Mac_Index).
3. Implement monetization and SEO strategies with tools like Google Adsense.
